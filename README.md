# WILD

**WILD** (Wireless, Interactive, Lightweight Datalogger) is an ultra-lightweight multimodal neurologger for long-term neural and behavioral recording in freely behaving animals. It combines local neural data logging, behavioral sensing, onboard processing, and responsive stimulation in a head-mounted platform designed for naturalistic and multi-animal experiments.

## Documentation

The documentation portal is built with MkDocs Material and is maintained through Markdown files in [`docs/`](docs/).

- [Getting Started](docs/getting-started/index.md)
- [Hardware](docs/hardware/index.md)
- [Software](docs/software/index.md)
- [Analysis](docs/analysis/index.md)
- [Community](docs/contributing.md)

## Platform Scope

- Local microSD electrophysiology recording with BLE-based control, synchronization, status, and low-bandwidth preview
- Closed-loop stimulation through embedded DSP and curated TinyML pipelines
- Current open-source 64-channel workflows, with Neuropixels-compatible and active-probe variants documented separately as research targets
- IMU, ultrasonic audio, camera, and digital event recording
- TinyML inference support through validated release-integrated models
- Long-term recording and multi-animal experiment workflows
